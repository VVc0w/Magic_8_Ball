# Magic_8_Ball

A simple Magic 8-Ball made with JavaScript. At present this works using conditional "if else statements". 

Eventually I will integrate the JavaScript with HTML and CSS to make a functional and interactive website to host the Magic 8-Ball so that people can try it out.

When I learn of a better way to do the same thing with less lines of code I will come back and edit, but for now, it works!

--- How this works ---
The code prompts the user to ask a question (then totally ignores the question!) The answers that the 8-ball gives are tied to numbers between 0 and 200, the code generates a random number between 0 and 200 and spits out an answer.
