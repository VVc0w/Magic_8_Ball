# Magic_8_Ball

A simple Magic 8-Ball made with JavaScript. At present this works using conditional "if else statements". 

Eventually I will integrate the JavaScript with HTML and CSS to make a functional and interactive website to host the Magic 8-Ball so that people can try it out.

When I find/learn of a better way to do the same thing with less lines of code I will come back and edit, but for now, it works!
